      Researchers Accidentally Find Simple Way to Convert Harmful CO2 Gas to Green Energy
    text: >
      In the scientific world, there is something called serendipity. The word is used to denote the occurrence or invention of something beneficial by chance. For years, governments and climate change activists have struggled to convince the world to cut down on greenhouse emissions. A greenhouse gas is any gaseous compound in the atmosphere that is capable of absorbing infrared radiation, thereby trapping and holding heat in the atmosphere. By increasing the heat in the atmosphere, greenhouse gases are responsible for the greenhouse effect, which ultimately leads to global warming.

      Leaked Emails Show Government Corruption in Approving Aspartame
    text: >
      Artificial sweeteners such as aspartame are typically used to sweeten so-called â€œdietâ€ foods and beverages in lieu of sugar or high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The idea is that reducing your calorie consumption will result in weight loss. However, research has completely demolished this notion, showing that artificial sweeteners actually have the converse effect; they actually lower appetite suppressant chemicals and encourage sugar cravings and sugar dependence, thereby raising your odds of unwanted weight gain. [1],[2] Research has repeatedly shown that artificial sweeteners promote insulin resistance and related health problems just like regular sugar does, including [3],[4],[5] cardiovascular disease, stroke [6],[7] and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. While poor diet is a major driver of Alzheimerâ€™s in general (the primary culprits being sugar/fructose and grains, especially gluten ), the key mechanism of harm here appears to be methanol toxicity â€” a much-ignored problem associated with aspartame in particular. In a previous interview, toxicology expert Woodrow Monte, Ph.D., (author of the book â€œWhile Science Sleeps: A Sweetener Killsâ€ [8]) explains the links between aspartame and methanol toxicity and the formation of toxic formaldehyde.

      Girl Soldiers: Forgotten Casualties of War
    text: >
      As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was visibly shaken by sexual crimes against women and girls when she visited the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2009. Sexual crimes in this central African country, known as the â€œrape capital of the world,â€ include the sexual exploitation of tens of thousands of girls abducted and trapped as child soldiers. Nonetheless, since 2010, President Obama has waived a congressionally mandated ban on military aid to countries known to exploit child soldiers, among them the DRC.The DRCâ€™s eastern region is exceedingly rich in rare minerals and exceedingly rife with decades of brutal war over those minerals. This country and three others â€“ Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan â€“ each of which exploits thousands of child soldiers, will receive more than $161 million in U.S. military aid in fiscal year 2016.

      One Treaty Could Change the Fight to Stop the Dakota Access Pipeline
    text: >
      The fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline isnâ€™t only about water rights and sacred sites; itâ€™s also about the U.S. governmentâ€™s historical refusal to honor treatiesâ€”when â€œthey interfered with Manifest Destiny.â€ Washington violated its treaty with the Sioux in 1877, and later declared its power to void all Native treaties. â€œThere are now talks of using the treaty to legally regain land rights to end the pipeline's construction.â€ One Treaty Could Change the Fight to Stop the Dakota Access Pipeline by Yessenia Funes Highway 1806 has become the no surrender line.â€
      When activists talk about the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline [1] and the Native uprising surrounding its construction, they often frame it with regard to the environment. Water. Sacred burial grounds. Grandmother Earth. Opponents site potential environmental risks to water resources like the Missouri and Mississippi rivers to defend their stance against the 1,172-mile long pipeline, which would

      Globalization Expressway to Universal Slavery
    text: >
      If humans were largely moral and ethical beings, then globalization could be a workable proposition. Unfortunately, the dark behavioral narcissism expressed by compulsive greed and an infinite appetite for power seems to have become the guiding precept of our collective nightmare. If only the desire to dominate others and have a lot more than them were not the prime motivations for the global elite on top of the human food chain, we could all have our respective modest slice of happiness on this planet. The Utopia of globalization through institutions such as the United Nations (UN), World Bank , and International Monetary Fund (IMF) was supposed to eradicate the universal pestilence of war, extreme poverty , hunger and slavery using the might of the above supranational institutions to prevent the rise of so-called rogue nations usually ruled by dictators.

      We are at the point in Earth history, the breaking point. Humanity, (letâ€™s be fair shall we?) western â€œcivilizationâ€ has virtually killed the only home we have. There is no place for homeless humanity to go when this home becomes habitable only for cockroaches and similarly hardy beasts. Those in the worst offender nation, the United States, have allowed themselves to be pacified into disbelief that we are, or even can, destroy the only home we have. Much of that willing disbelief is founded on a welll orchestrated propaganda campagn carried out by the fossil fuel industry and the owners of it such as the Koch Brothers.

      Al Gore Made Nearly $200 Million from the Global Warming Scam â€” Likely to Become the World's First 'Carbon Billionaire'

      Ten years after the release of Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth, none of the film's dire climate change predictions have come to pass. However, in the decade since the documentary was produced, its creator has raked in millions of dollars from the entire "global warming" scam, and is now poised to become " our first carbon billionaire ."In the 2006 film, Gore made a number of wild claims regarding what we could expect to see happening over the next few years due to global warming, but virtually all of his alarmist prognostications have turned out to be false. Arctic didn't melt, polar bears are thriving For instance, the film predicted that that the Arctic could become ice-free within the next decades, and that polar bears would begin drowning. Both claims were untrue.As reported by Investor's Business Daily:"In the mid- to late-2000s, Gore repeatedly predicted that an ice-free Arctic Ocean was coming soon."But as usual, his fortune-telling was wrong. By 2014, Arctic ice had grown thicker and covered a greater area than it did when he made his prediction."And the polar bears?T

      President Trump: Man-Made Global Warming is a Hoax

      Man-made global warming is a hoax perpetuated by the elite to make money and damage the U.S. economy, according to President-elect Donald Trump â€“ and America isnâ€™t going to stand for it anymore. â€œObama thinks itâ€™s the number one problem in the world today. I think itâ€™s very low on the list,â€ Trump said on the Hugh Hewitt show, indicating a major shift in U.S. policy. Trump continued: â€œYou know in the 1920s people talked about global cooling, they thought the earth was cooling. I believe there is weather and I believe there is change and I believe it goes up and it goes down and it goes up again and it changes depending on years and centuries.â€œ Pointing out that U.S. manufacturing and the economy as a whole has suffered since climate change rules were introduced by global organizations â€“ making everybody poorer, except the elites who profit from the fearmongering â€“ Trump has promised to make America competitive again.Trump is putting his money where his mouth is. According to a member of his transition team, the President-elect is looking at ways to withdraw as quickly as possible from a costly global climate agreement currently being ratified in Morocco.

      Mankind destroys animal kingdom with enormous velocity 27.10.2016 Print version Font Size The populations of vertebrate creatures - mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles - have decreased by 58% as a result of human activities from 1970 to 2012, The Living Planet report published by the WWF and the Zoological Society of London.The greatest damage was caused to freshwater vertebrates. Their total populations haves reduced by 81% during 42 years. The populations of terrestrial vertebrates have decreased by 38% and marine - by 36% in the same period. The report was based on the research data collected for 3,706 species of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles.The researchers concluded that the most common threat to the vertebrates is either the loss or the deterioration of their natural habitats."Wildlife is disappearing within our lifetimes at an unprecedented rate," said Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International.

      Economic upgrade: Russia receives multiple endorsements for rapidly improving business conditions
    text: >
      Successful eurobond sale in September, credit upgrade by Fitch, and sharp improvement in World Bank Ease of Doing Business ranking, all confirm effectiveness of Russian government's economic policies, amidst strengthening recovery. As economic recovery in Russia continues to gain hold, Russia has received authoritative endorsement both for its successful macroeconomic policies and for its rapidly improving business conditions. The US credit rating agency Fitch on 14th October 2016 upgraded Russia's rating from BBB- (negative) to BBB- (stable). Normally I pay no attention to ratings decisions by US credit rating agencies, which have been proved repeatedly wrong, and which in Russia's case are blatantly politicised. Back in 2015, during the worst period of the recession, I pointed out how obviously and completely wrong the decisions of the US credit rating agencies to downgrade Russia's credit rating at that time were. The market clearly agrees with me. Fitch's Russia rating is only just investment grade, whilst those of S&P and Moody's actually give Russia a junk rating.

Despite the fact that evidence shows that GM mosquitoes were responsible for the deadly virus spreading across the globe, scientists have been given the go-ahead by the government to release the GM mosquitoes into the wild. Recommended A doctor has said that he believes the release of 5 million GM mosquitoes per week in Brazil may be causing a rise in brain cancer among humans. (2 hours ago) Phys.org reports: They will mate with the females of the ordinary mosquitoes, spawning babies with a genetically inbuilt flaw that causes them to die quickly. With their work done, the modified father mosquitoes will then give up the ghost themselvesâ€”as they are genetically programmed to do.

      Earth's Magnetic Field is COLLAPSING and The Poles Are About To Switch
    text: >
      As it turns out â€“ according to studiesâ€” our planets magnetic field could flip in our lifetime. According to experts , the position of the South Pole has shifted and is not located precisely at Antarctica, the North Pole is also believed to be â€˜racingâ€™ across the Arctic Ocean. Earthâ€™s magnetic field appears to be collapsing which could severely damage our climate and WIPE OUT power grids across the world. Our planetâ€™s magnetic field exists because Earth has a massive â€˜ball of ironâ€™ at its core which is surrounded by an outer layer of molten metal. As the earthâ€™s magnetic field varies over time, the positions of the north and south magnetic poles gradually change. The magnetic declination at a given location also changes over time. As it turns out a lot has changed in the last couple of hundred years, and to see what we are taking about visit NOAA and take a look at Historical Magnetic Declination . Interestingly, according to previous studies, Earthâ€™s magnetic field â€“ which shields our planet from blasts of deadly solar radiation has dangerously weakened in the last couple of years. According to reports from the European Space Agency , the biggest weak spots seen in the magnetic field are located in the western hemisphere.

      Call for Action to Tackle Growing Ethnic Segregation Across UK
    text: >
      Politicians must urgently tackle the increasing ethnic polarisation of many of Britainâ€™s towns and cities, according to a senior academic, as he revealed figures showing how rapidly the white British population had dwindled in urban â€œpocketsâ€ across England. Prof Ted Cantle, who first authored a report into community cohesion after a series of race riots in 2001, said his new study showed that in the most extreme cases the white British population had more than halved in two decades.  Cantle, who co-authored the report with Prof Eric Kaufmann at Birkbeck, University of London, told the Guardian that white British families should be encouraged to remain in ethnically diverse areas to reduce the trend. He warned that segregated societies â€œbreed intolerance and prejudiceâ€, adding: â€œAnd we know the opposite is trueâ€“there is a huge amount of research that shows any form of contact does break down stereotypes.â€ The leading academic said he would not describe the trend as white flight because that indicated that people were moving because of ethnic mixing, while this research only established the facts and not necessarily the causes.

Philippe Mignonet, the deputy mayor of Calais, believes the demolition of the â€˜Jungleâ€™ refugee camp will not stop the thousands of migrants from congregating in the French port town in the hope of crossing the English Channel. â€œThe UK government says it does not want any more migrants but it never expels migrants who get there,â€ Mignonet told the Daily Mail . â€œThey claim benefits and housing, and all we get is the British-funded wall and fences.â€ For Mignonet, the Â£2 million (US$2.4 million) British-funded wall being built around the loading area of the Eurotunnel, which allows goods trucks to come from France into Britain, is simply not enough. â€œWhat English city would accept a fence and a wall being built by another country on their land? If the British government want to improve matters, they should come and talk to the city of Calais,â€ he added.

      Fury over Syrian refugee claiming $392,000 for 4 wives and 22 kids, pleads he can't work due to 'family commitments'
    text: >
      One Syrian landed last year in Germany with his family of four wives and 23 children, in the invited flood of one million refugees. He recently raised shock waves after it was reported that he was receiving an astounding sum of 360,000 Euros as benefits for the year. That tidy sum works out to 392904 USD. His real name is not disclosed. Ghazia A - as he known in the media - has "resettled" in Germany, though one of his daughters shifted back to Saudi Arabia and married. While a financial manager on the Employers' Association website calculated that he was getting a huge sum of 360,000 Euros, there is no official confirmation of the amount. Germany does not legally sanction or recognize polygamy. Yet, it is footing the bill for his "large family." He was given special exemption, so Ghazia had to select a "main wife", with the rest of the family taking benefits as "friends" of Ghazia. In Montabaur, an official had said that it was a situation that could be called an "exemption". The secondary wives shifted to nearby communities almost 31 miles away, while Ghazia lives with the "main wife" Twasif and their five children.

      There’s been media coverage of a woman Louise Rosealma being wrestled to the ground by a man. Rosealma was part of the Antifa group in Berkeley, California that attacked pro-Trump marchers. Nathan Damigo, a Marine veteran who was there saw that Rosealma was putting M80 explosive devices inside glass bottles and throwing them at the pro-Trump rally marchers. So Louise Rosealma was literally making IED’s. This makes her no better than the Boston Marathon bombers. According to Wikipedia: M-80s are an American class of large powerful firecrackers, sometimes called salutes. M-80s were originally made in the early 20th century by the U.S. military to simulate explosives or artillery fire; later, M-80s were manufactured as fireworks. You can see in the picture (above right) that she has her weapon, a glass bottle with an M80 in it, in her hand as Damigo hits her in the face to subdue the bomb threat.

      Egyptian mosque turned into house of torture for Christians after Muslim Brotherhood protest
    text: >
      Islamic hard-liners stormed a mosque in suburban Cairo, turning it into torture chamber for Christians who had been demonstrating against the ruling Muslim Brotherhood in the latest case of violent persecution that experts fear will only get worse.
      Such stories have become increasingly common as tensions between Egypt’s Muslims and Copts mount, but in the latest case, mosque officials corroborated much of the account and even filed a police report. Demonstrators, some of whom were Muslim, say they were taken from the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in suburban Cairo to a nearby mosque on Friday and tortured for hours by hard-line militia members.
      “They accompanied me to one of the mosques in the area and I discovered the mosque was being used to imprison demonstrators and torture them,” Amir Ayad, a Coptic who has been a vocal protester against the regime, told MidEast Christian News from a hospital bed.
      Ayad  said he was beaten for hours with sticks before being left for dead on a roadside. Amir’s brother, Ezzat Ayad, said he received an anonymous phone call at 3 a.m. Saturday, with the caller saying his brother had been found near death and had been taken to the ambulance.

      The ACLU issues a “travel advisory” for Texas after the state bans sanctuary cities
    text: >
      The American Civil Liberties Union has issued a “travel alert” for people traveling to Texas, warning them that after the passage of a new law, their constitutional rights might be violated during a routine traffic stop.  The law, signed by governor Greg Abbot on May 7 while on Facebook Live, is the country’s strictest ban on so-called sanctuary cities, where officials can decide to limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The new regulation allows law-enforcement officers to ask anyone they detain, even in a traffic stop, about their immigration status. The ACLU says this will lead to “widespread racial profiling, baseless scrutiny, and illegal arrests of citizens and non-citizens alike presumed to be “foreign” based on how they look or sound.” SB4, as the law is known, also requires local law-enforcement officials to cooperate with federal immigration authorities who request they detain people suspected of being in the US illegally.

This is TYRANNY, folks, plain and simple, and it should horrify every American who values their Constitutional rights to free speech and free assembly. The tyrannical line of Trump’s lawyer is that American citizens have “no right” to convey “dissenting views” at Trump’s rallies because these protests violate the Orange One’s free speech.

Knowing this, Black members of the class of 2017 decided to form an individual ceremony. It’s the first of its kind at the school in recent memory and took nearly a year to plan," reports BET. "The separate graduation is an effort to highlight the aforementioned struggles and resilience it takes to get through those."The Root similarly lamented how difficult college life can be for minorities: "The ceremony comes at a time when the experiences of Black students on college campuses in America have been marked by incidents of overt racism, microaggressions, passive racist comments, and the marginalization of minority experiences in both reading assignments and learning materials."

      Melania Trump "liked" a tweet that poked fun at her relationship with her husband, President Donald Trump.
    text: >
      On 2 May 2017, Twitter user Andy Ostroy posted a gif showing First Lady Melania Trump looking sad after smiling at her husband, President Donald Trump, alongside a message about their perceived icy relationship: "Seems the only #Wall @realDonaldTrump's built is the one between him and @FLOTUS #Melania #trump". Shortly afterward, Ostroy was surprised (and initially skeptical) when he saw that his tweet had been “liked” by Melania Trump herself. A Twitter account belonging to Melania Trump did “like” Ostroy’s message. However, there are several things that should be noted about this social media interaction. First, it was Melania Trump’s personal account (@MelaniaTrump) that like this message and not the official First Lady account (@FLotUS). Second, her account quickly “unliked” this message. Screen shots from archive.is show that this “like” appeared on her page for at least a half hour.

'The manager sang along as well. Do you really feel that was appropriate?' the Facebook post read.

      GOP Sen. Tom Cotton Comes Out As “Ex-Gay”, Defends Gay Conversion Therapy: “It Worked For Me”
    text: >
      Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton has come out as “ex-gay” while speaking out in defense of ‘Gay Conversion Therapy” (torture) saying that he himself has been “cured” of the “horrible affliction” of being a……… HOMOSEXUAL!! Cotton claims that the organization People Can Change (PCC) was successful in treating him and he no longer suffers from having “strong and uncontrollable homosexual desires”. Cotton participated in PCC’s ‘Journey into Manhood‘, described as a “48-hour immersion in intensive emotional-healing work, designed specifically for men who are self-motivated and serious about resolving unwanted sexual attractions.” “I gave it shot, and boy am I glad I did,” Cotton told Tony Perkins, leader of the Family Research Council hate group. “I know it may not help everyone but it worked for me, [you] just need to find the right program that works for you.” Cotton continued, “I am now the man I always knew I could be, fully dedicated to God, my wife, and the good people of Arkansas, without all the urges to have sex with hot guys 24 hours a day.”

      Sour Honey shown ito demolish breast cancer cells on the spot
    text: >
      In the heart of the Brazilian jungle, a tiny, remote area exists where special bees create one of the rarest substances on earth… It’s a type of “sour honey” that has remained untouched for thousands of years. Until it was recently tested in a lab and delivered these near-miraculous results. Within 24 hours, Sour Honey was shown in vitro to demolish breast cancer cells on the spot – killing 13% of the cancer in just the first day alone! And in a separate study, looking at human-like tumors on mice, tumor growth was halted a full 50% with Sour Honey.And on two different aggressive types of prostate cancer cells, Sour Honey was shown in vitro to boost the speed in killing the cancer… destroying up to 75% of the cancer cells in the study!

      If you thought that a presidential administration led by a confessed sexual harasser and a guy who calls his wife "Mother" was bound to have some weird issues about women, oh boy were you ever correct. But it's not just wrinkly old men who are bent on rolling back abortion and contraceptive rights. With his latest appointee, the Trump camp has shown that women can hate women, too.On Friday, the White House announced a new round of appointees, among them Charmaine Yoest, who nabbed a job as Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, Public Affairs. The position involves imparting health information and policy to the country at large, which is a problem given that Yoest seems to have a grasp on medical science that's slippery at best.

      President Donald Trump was roundly mocked yesterday for the historical illiteracy evident in his Andrew Jackson quotes. Now Golf Digest is revisiting an earlier scandal involving Trump’s ignorance of the Civil War. “Many great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this spot,” reads the inscription a faux historical marker on the course of the Trump National Golf Club, according to the New York Times. “The casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as ‘The River of Blood.’ The battle never happened. “No. Uh-uh. No way,” Richard Gillespie, the executive director of the Mosby Heritage Area Association told the New York Times. “Nothing like that ever happened there.”

      Canada, Norway, and Germany offer federally paid family leave programs for up  to 1 year
    text: >
      On 14 March 2017, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) office posted an image on his Facebook page criticizing the lack of federally-funded family leave in the U.S. by highlighting how similar policies are implemented in three other countries. Sanders, who ran for the Democratic Party’s 2016 presidential nomination, expressed support for a federal family leave program in the U.S., as stated on his campaign website. In my view, every worker in America should be guaranteed at least twelve weeks of paid family and medical leave. That’s why I am a proud cosponsor of the FAMILY Act, introduced by Senator [Kirsten] Gillibrand, which does just that. Under this measure, every employee would receive twelve weeks of paid family and medical leave: to take care of a baby, to help a family member who has been diagnosed with cancer or another serious medical condition, or to care for themselves if they become seriously ill. This would be funded through an insurance program, like Social Security. Workers would pay into it with every paycheck, at the price of roughly one cup of coffee per week. There is no reason not to pass this bill now.

      Legislative time bomb: There is no consensus about humain -induced climate change
    text: >
      Over the past 250 years, humans have added just one part of CO2 in 10,000 to the atmosphere. One volcanic cough can do this in a day. Climate chestnuts about polar ice are commonly raised. What is not raised is that ice is dynamic, it advances and retreats, while the Arctic is warming the Antarctic is cooling and vice versa and if ice did not retreat, then the planet would be covered in ice. For less than 20 per cent of time Earth has had ice. The Antarctic ice sheet has been with us for 37 million years during which time there were extended periods of warmth and the ice sheet did not disappear. So too with the Greenland ice sheet which has enjoyed nearly three million years of expansion and contraction yet did not disappear in extended times far warmer than at present. Sea level is also dynamic and has risen and fallen over time by at least 600 metres. Since the end of the glaciation 14,000 years ago, sea level has risen some 130 metres at almost one centimetre per year. It is now at about one milimetre per year.

      Teacher arrested for stapling a “loudmouth” student's lips shut
    text: >
      Springfield, Missouri | A 61-year old high school teacher was arrested this morning, after she allegedly assaulted a student with a stapler in order to “keep his mouth shut”. According to witnesses at the Central High School, Dorothy Fransen was furious after one of her students, 17-year old Jeremy Dunlop, kept interrupting her class and making jokes about her physical appearance. She reportedly tackled the young man and held him on the ground while stapling his lips more than 45 times. Amanda Jones, one of the victim’s classmates who witnessed the whole incident, says that the teacher “completely lost it” after the young man made a joke about her weight. “She was just enraged! She yelled ‘This will shut you up, you little fucker!’ and just jumped on him. She held him down and then she began stapling his lips over and over again.”

      BREAKING: Trump Makes One Phone Call–Stephen Colbert Fired
    text: >
      President Trump made a single phone call this morning to the CEO of CBS and voila…Stephen Colbert was fired as host of the Late Show. According to Jeff Derpinger of the White House Office of Information and Propaganda, President Trump talked to J.L. Meshner for about five minutes and told him he can either find a new host for the Late Show or kiss his network’s White House press credentials goodbye. The New York Times is already calling it blackmail because they love to put out fake news headlines. Colbert’s lawyer says the comedian will be filing suit against CBS and President Trump. He claims that not only is CBS in breach of contract but that Trump violated federal law when he used the Office of the President to carry out an act of “revenge.” What he doesn’t weem to get is that Trump is the chief executive and can pretty much do whatever he wants if it’s in the best interest of the country, which this is. Maybe Colbert should go back to Comedy Central where he belongs.
